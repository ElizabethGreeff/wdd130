            <p>South Africa is one of the most entertaining places to live.
                My home is in the mother city, Cape Town. My home is known for its good food,
                good people, and good celebrations. South Africa is at the southern tip of Africa, sorrounded by water
                 and springing with life. South Africa has many famous attractions, most commonly known are 
                 Kruger National Park and Table mountain.
